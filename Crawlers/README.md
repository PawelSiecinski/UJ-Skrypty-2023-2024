# Explanation

I am not sure why sometimes subpages are N/A despite having proper links and subclasses. Maybe its because of overlay/built-in prevention against web crawlers.
I have tried to implement different user_agents to prevent this, however the problem still sometimes occurs.

### Example output
How the propert output in this case should look like:
